JSON is one of the most important concepts of every programmer.

1. What is `JSON`?

- JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation
- It is used widely in APIs and Configs
- JSON is lightweight and easy to read and write
- JSON integrates easily with most languages

2. `JSON` Object Types

JSON supports

- Strings
- Numbers
- Booleans
- Arrays
- Objects

3. Object Data Type

- Object Data Type is the most complex but is widely used
- It contains a key and a value

4. Let's create a `JSON` file that containes Name, Age and Location of your  
   customers.

- Use any text editor to create a file Customer.json file (extension must be .
  json)
- A company will have several customers, so we will use an array.
- Each customer has attributes such as Name, Age and location, so we will use
  object.

5. Arrays start with [and close with]. So let's start with these brackets as
   we want to creare an array of customers.

```
   [

   ]
```

6. We will now create an object to fill out customer attributes in between
   the open brackets.

```
[
    Insert Object here
]
```

7. Let's create first entry. Each entry starts with `curly braces{.` Given
   below is a customer Sujay who is 35 years old and his favourite color is black.

```
[
    {
        "Name":"Sujay",
        "Age":35,
        "FavoriteColor":"Black"
    }
]
```

7. Let's create another entry.

```
[
    {
        "Name":"Sujay",
        "Age":35,
        "FavoriteColor":"Black"
    },
    {
        "Name":"Michael",
        "Age":45,
        "FavoriteColor":"Blue"
    }
]
```
